# BeerJS Vestfold

BeerJS Vestfold aims to be an informal social platform for software developers. We'll get together, have a refreshing beverage or two, and chat about all the awesome things only other programmers find remotely interesting.

## When and where

[The inaugural meetup](https://www.meetup.com/BeerJS-Vestfold/events/262125981/) will be held on Friday June 14th, hosted by [GSGroup AS](https://onegsgroup.com/).

Looking forward to seeing you,
Cheers!
