# BeerJS Vestfold

BeerJS Vestfold aims to be an informal social platform for software developers. We'll get together, have a refreshing beverage or two, and chat about all the awesome things only other programmers find remotely interesting.

## When and where

The inaugural meetup will be held on Friday June 14th, hosted by [https://onegsgroup.com/](GSGroup AS).

Further meetups will be announced on [https://www.meetup.com/BeerJS-Vestfold/](Meetup.com)

Looking forward to seeing you,
Cheers!
